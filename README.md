Project I made when I was at first semester in uni, just knew pseudo-code. My past self was a hacker.
I know the code is a mess, and the html, and the css, and the jquery-ui import was not the best idea, but I just knew variables, cycles and functions.
PD: I had multiple versions (no git), I checked all I found and each "version" has something different, but this is the most complete, just lacks the lines that joins the matches.
